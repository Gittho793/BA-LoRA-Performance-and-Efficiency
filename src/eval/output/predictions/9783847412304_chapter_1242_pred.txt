 The analysis referred to the transformational impact of the EPP GIZ2 program on the self, on institutions and on society. 
In general, the approach was bottom-up, inductive, transdisciplinary and participatory. The use of the term ‘participatory’ was understood to indicate a process that was not only consultative but also empowered the participants to make decisions. The approach was also image-based, as it made use of the visual arts. The study intended to contribute to the field of education, by providing new insights into the impact of a program on the self, on institutions and on society. 
In summary, the multi-method approach adopted in the study intended to over- come social background differences by focusing on inclusion and took into account possible limitations of expression. The image-based methodology used intended to elicit comments and to support elicitation, articulation and storytelling. The core structure of the ‘Appreciative Inquiry’ (AI) was applied, which is an experience and storytelling / dream / design / delivery approach. 
3.	 Program, Research Methodology and Program ­Evaluation Design (continued) 

### Program Evaluation Design

The program evaluation design was developed by the EPP GIZ2 team, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the German Development Agency (GIZ). The design was based on the principles of the Appreciative Inquiry (AI), which is an approach that focuses on appreciating and building on the positive aspects of a situation. 

### Research Methods

The research methods used in the study were a combination of participatory design research workshops, group discussions, and interviews. The methods were chosen to ensure that the study was inclusive and participatory, and that the results were relevant and meaningful to the stakeholders. 

### Data Analysis

The data analysis was conducted by the EPP GIZ2 team, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the GIZ. The analysis was based on the data collected through the research methods, and it focused on the transformational impact of the program on the self, on institutions, and on society. 

### Results

The results of the study showed that the EPP GIZ2 program had a significant impact on the self, on institutions, and on society, and that it contributed to the development of young people's skills and knowledge. 

### Conclusion

The study concluded that the EPP GIZ2 program was an effective way to develop young people's skills and knowledge, and that it contributed to the development of their personalities and futures. 

### Recommendations

The study recommended that the EPP GIZ2 program be continued and that it be further developed and improved to ensure that it remains relevant and effective. 

### Limitations

The study had several limitations, including the fact that it was a small-scale study and that it did not provide a comprehensive overview of the EPP GIZ2 program. 

### Future Research

The study suggested that further research be conducted to provide a more comprehensive overview of the EPP GIZ2 program and its impact on the self, on institutions, and on society.
