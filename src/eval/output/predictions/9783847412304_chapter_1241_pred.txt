The resonance and program impact for parents, teachers and project staff are analysed in the empirical section. The question is, how the CG program impacts the views of parents, teachers and project staff, and if it changes their views. The impact is analyzed in relation to the rationalities being brought into existence. The CG program is seen as an opportunity to change the views of parents, teachers and project staff, and to bring about a transformative change. The impact is analyzed in relation to the rationalities being brought into existence, and the question is, if the CG program can bring about a change in the views of parents, teachers and project staff, and if it can create a resonance that goes beyond the program itself. 
3.	 Conclusion 
In conclusion, the CG program has an impact on the views of parents, teachers and project staff, and it changes their views. The impact is analyzed in relation to the rationalities being brought into existence, and the question is, if the CG program can bring about a change in the views of parents, teachers and project staff, and if it can create a resonance that goes beyond the program itself.
